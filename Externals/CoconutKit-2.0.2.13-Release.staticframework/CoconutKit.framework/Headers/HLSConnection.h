 * Create a parent - child relationship between the receiver and another connection. When cancelling the receiver,
 * all associated child connections will be cancelled as well. Note that a connection can at most have one parent.
 * If the parent - child relationship is established when the parent connection is not running, both the parent
 * and child connections will be started when the parent connection is started. If the parent connection is already
 * running when the parent - child relationship is established, the child connection will be automatically started
 * (with the same run loop modes as the parent connection)
 *
 * Child connections can be useful to implement cascading requests. Take for example an object which must be filled using
 * two requests. You want the process to happen as if only one connection is actually running. This can be easily achieved
 * using a child connection
 *
 * Note that you are responsible of avoiding cycles when creating parent / child relationships, otherwise the behavior
 * is undefined
