/**
 * Abstract class for easy view creation using nibs.
 *
 * Simply inherit from this class to define your custom view classes (this class is abstract and therefore not meant
 * to be instantiated directly). This forces you to define view properties in a standard and centralized way (namely 
 * in the implementation file of the corresponding class), instead of putting redundant code in all source files using
 * the view.
 *
 * To create your own view class, simply subclass HLSNibView. If your view layout is created using a nib file not
 * bearing the same name as the view class, override the -nibName accessor to return the name of the nib file.
 * If the nib file bears the same name as its corresponding class, you do not need to override this accessor.
 * Your custom classes can then be instantiated using the +view class method. By default, the nib is searched
 * in the main bundle. If your nib is located in another bundle, override the +bundle method
 *
 * To define the view layout in Interface Builder, the first object in the nib must be the view object. Do not forget
 * to set its type to match your view class name (if you need to bind outlets). Use this class as origin when drawing 
 * bindings (do not use the file's owner)
 *
 * Designated initializer: -initWithFrame: (you usually do not need to create a view manually. Use the factory method 
 *                                          instead)
